Dynamic Pricing Intelligence System (DPIS)
1. Overview
1.1 Product Name

Dynamic Pricing Intelligence System (DPIS)

1.2 Product Summary

DPIS is an AI-driven pricing optimization platform that automatically adjusts product prices using competitor intelligence, demand forecasting, and mathematical optimization to maximize profit while respecting business constraints.

The system continuously monitors competitor pricing, forecasts demand sensitivity, and computes optimal pricing decisions in near real-time.

2. Business Problem
Current Challenges

Retailers face several pricing inefficiencies:

• Manual pricing decisions based on incomplete data
• Slow reaction to competitor price changes
• Lost margin due to underpricing
• Lost sales due to overpricing
• Lack of demand elasticity understanding
• Inability to optimize profit dynamically

Example Scenario

Competitor drops price from £100 → £90
Retailer reacts 2 days later → loses sales and market share

OR

Retailer prices too low → unnecessary margin loss

3. Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal

Maximize profit automatically using data-driven pricing decisions.

Secondary Goals

• Increase margin by 5–15%
• Increase revenue by 3–10%
• Reduce manual pricing work by 90%
• React to competitor price changes within minutes

4. Success Metrics (KPIs)
Metric	Target
Profit Margin Increase	+5–15%
Revenue Increase	+3–10%
Price Reaction Time	< 15 minutes
Forecast Accuracy	> 85%
Price Update Success Rate	> 99%
Manual Pricing Reduction	> 90%

7. Agent Specifications
Agent 1: Scraper Agent
Purpose

Collect competitor pricing and product intelligence.

Inputs

• Product identifiers (SKU, ASIN, URL)

Outputs

• Competitor price
• Seller name
• Timestamp
• Stock availability

Tools

• requests
• BeautifulSoup
• Scrapy
• Playwright (for dynamic pages)

Frequency

Every 5–30 minutes

Failure Handling

Retry logic
Fallback scrapers
Proxy rotation

Agent 2: Demand Forecast Agent
Purpose

Predict demand as a function of price and time.

Inputs

• Historical prices
• Sales volume
• Competitor prices
• Seasonality
• Promotions

Outputs

Demand forecast function:

Demand = f(price, time, competitor_price, seasonality)
Models Used

Linear Regression

Demand = β0 + β1 * Price + β2 * CompetitorPrice

ARIMA

Time-series demand forecasting

Elasticity Model

Elasticity = % Demand Change / % Price Change

Libraries

• numpy
• pandas
• statsmodels
• scikit-learn

Output Example
Price: £100 → Demand: 50 units
Price: £90 → Demand: 65 units
Price: £110 → Demand: 40 units
Agent 3: Optimization Agent
Purpose

Calculate optimal price that maximizes profit.

Profit Function
Profit=(Price−Cost)×Demand(Price)
Optimization Goal

Maximize Profit subject to constraints.

Inputs

• Cost
• Demand function
• Constraints

Methods Used

Gradient Descent

or

Scipy Constrained Optimization

scipy.optimize.minimize()
Constraints

Minimum margin:

Price ≥ Cost × (1 + MinMargin)

Maximum price limit

Inventory constraints

Output

Optimal Price Recommendation

Example:

Current Price: £100
Optimal Price: £107
Expected Profit Increase: +12%
Agent 4: Strategy Agent
Purpose

Apply business logic and override rules.

Business Rules

Minimum Margin Rule

Price ≥ Cost × 1.15

Inventory Rule

If inventory low → increase price

Promotion Rule

If demand weak → lower price

Competitor Undercut Rule

Price slightly below competitor

Price = CompetitorPrice − £0.50
8. Mathematical Models
8.1 Price Elasticity
Elasticity = (%Δ Demand) / (%Δ Price)

Interpretation

Elasticity > 1 → Price sensitive
Elasticity < 1 → Not price sensitive

8.2 Regression Model
Demand = β0 + β1Price + β2CompetitorPrice + ε
8.3 Profit Maximization
Maximize:

Profit(P) = (P − Cost) × Demand(P)

Solve:

dProfit/dP = 0
8.4 Constrained Optimization
Maximize Profit(P)

Subject to:

P ≥ Cost × (1 + Margin)
P ≤ MaxPrice
